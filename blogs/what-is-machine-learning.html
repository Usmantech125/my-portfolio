        <p>
          Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gives systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
          It focuses on the development of algorithms that can access data, learn from it, and make predictions or decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is Machine Learning Important?</h2>
        <p>
          In the modern world, data is everywhere. From smartphones to online shopping, almost every action generates data. Machine learning helps us make sense of this data and use it to automate processes, make better decisions, and build intelligent systems. From healthcare to finance, its impact is everywhere.
        </p>

        <h2>How Does Machine Learning Work?</h2>
        <p>
          Machine Learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data," to make predictions or decisions. The process usually includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collecting and cleaning data</li>
          <li>Selecting a suitable algorithm</li>
          <li>Training the model with data</li>
          <li>Testing the model's performance</li>
          <li>Tuning and improving based on results</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning can be broadly categorized into:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm is trained on labeled data. Example: Spam detection.</li>
          <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The model works on unlabeled data to find patterns. Example: Customer segmentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns through trial and error to maximize rewards. Example: Self-driving cars, game-playing bots.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Email spam and phishing detection</li>
          <li>House price prediction</li>
          <li>Image and speech recognition</li>
          <li>Chatbots and voice assistants</li>
          <li>Medical diagnosis from X-rays and scans</li>
          <li>Fraud detection in banking</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
          As computing power and data availability grow, machine learning will continue to evolve. From generative AI to autonomous systems, it's redefining how humans interact with technology. Those with ML expertise are in high demand across all industries.
